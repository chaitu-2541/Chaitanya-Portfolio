                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <!-- <p>I am a passionate Software Development Engineer with over 4 years of professional experience and a growing expertise in Data Science & Machine Learning. My journey in tech began with a curiosity about how software could solve complex problems, leading me to pursue a career where I've developed enterprise applications that deliver real business value at ESKO Graphics.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by pursuing an MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science & Machine Learning from Scaler Neovarsity (accredited by WOOLF University). I'm combining my software engineering background with cutting-edge data science techniques to build more intelligent and data-driven solutions.</p>
                <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm an avid problem solver who enjoys participating in coding competitions and contributing to innovative projects. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and traditional software development, where I believe the next generation of transformative applications will emerge.</p>

<p>👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Sai Chaitanya, a data engineer turned student. At EPAM Systems, I gained in-depth MySQL expertise 💻, orchestrated job scheduling and AWS sync jobs ⏱️, and developed data pipelines with PySpark and Spark SQL 🚀. I also worked with Foundry tools 🔧 and Oracle Database management, managed Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 ☁️, and created RESTful web services 🌐 using Spring Boot with JUnit and Mockito. Professionally, I received the 🏆 Pat on Back, 👐 Helping Hand, and 🎓 Enthusiastic Learner awards from EPAM Systems, the 🥇 Best Tutor Award at SRK and Vijaya Colleges, and delivered lectures at 15 colleges. I was also the 🏅 Academic Topper in 2nd and 3rd semesters at DVR and Dr. HS MIC College, achieved 🌟 FIVE STARS on Hackerrank, and was rewarded for 🥇 coding competitions and 📝 poster and paper presentations across Andhra Pradesh.</p>
